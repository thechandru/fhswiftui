    "Based on my review of the fhswiftui package, here's my critique with the goal of making it usable for experienced Python developers to build beautiful interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear vision**: The SwiftUI-inspired API is a great approach - method chaining for modifiers is intuitive and readable\n",
    "2. **Good foundation**: Layout components (HStack, VStack, Spacer, Dividers) are well-designed\n",
    "3. **Solid documentation**: The notebook format with tests and examples is excellent\n",
    "4. **Tailwind integration**: Smart use of Tailwind utilities while hiding complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Issues to Address\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Missing Core UI Components**\n",
    "You mentioned wanting forms, text input/output, and widgets, but currently only have layout primitives. Priority additions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Text()` component (mentioned in README but not implemented)\n",
    "- `TextField()` / `TextArea()` for input\n",
    "- `Button()` (currently using raw Button from FastHTML)\n",
    "- `Label()` for form labels\n",
    "- `Card()` / `Group()` for grouping content\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Inconsistent API Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Some modifiers are methods (`.padding()`) while layout components are functions (`HStack()`). This creates confusion about what's chainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestion**: Consider making common layout containers also support method chaining:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "VStack(spacing=4).padding().bg(\"muted\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Missing Common Modifiers**\n",
    "\n",
    "For forms and UI, you'll need:\n",
    "- `.disabled()` - disable interactive elements\n",
    "- `.placeholder()` - for text inputs\n",
    "- `.on_click()` / `.on_change()` - event handlers (or document how to use HTMX)\n",
    "- `.width()` / `.height()` - size modifiers beyond frame()\n",
    "- `.align()` - text alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Form Support**\n",
    "\n",
    "Need a clean way to handle forms with HTMX:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Form(action=\"/submit\", method=\"post\")(\n",
    "    VStack(spacing=4)(\n",
    "        TextField(name=\"email\", placeholder=\"Email\"),\n",
    "        TextField(name=\"password\", type=\"password\"),\n",
    "        Button(\"Submit\").bg(\"primary\")\n",
    "    )\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to:\n",
    "1. Draft specific API designs for the missing components?\n",
    "2. Show code examples for how to implement them?\n",
    "3. Prioritize which components to build first?"
